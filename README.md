# Flavors-of-Cacao

Creating a data dashboard for Career Foundry Exercise 6.7

## Objective 
 To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

 ## Context
First conduct an exploratory visual analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then, after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard

## Data Set
Chocolate Bar Ratings: This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars from 2017. Source is from Kaggle accessed in June 2025.
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings/data?select=flavors_of_cacao.csv

 It Covers: 
 - Company: Name of manufacter specific
 - Bar name: The specific geo region of origin for the bar.
 - REF: Value linked to when the review was entered in the database.
 - Review date: When the chocolate was reviewed
 - Cocoa Percent: The percentage of cocoa solids in chocolate company.
 - Location: The country where the manufacturer is based.
 - Rating: Expert Ratings based on flavor, texture and aftermelt.
 - Bean Type: The variety of cacao beans used.
 - Broad Bean Origin: The broader geographical region of the bean source.

For Exercise 6.4 Machine Learning : Regression 
 - Data set I use : Building the Coffee Quality Institute Database These data contain reviews of 1312 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers.
- Source: These data were collected from the Coffee Quality Institute's review pages in January 2018.
- I sued the cleaned data from : https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database?tab=readme-ov-file
